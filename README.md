#### Welcome

Welcome to this exciting learning journey! This repository documents my adventure through the #28DaysOfPatternsForBeginningProggrammersCode challenge, focusing on Java 21. Inspired by David Bernstein's book *Patterns for Beginning Programmers*[^1], this project explores 28 programming patterns, with 5 exercises daily. I hope this resource will be valuable both for my learning and for other programming beginners.

#### Objective and Context

As a self-taught backend programming learner with Java, this project integrates several key technologies and tools. Bernstein's book has been the catalyst for this learning process, providing a solid foundation for understanding and applying programming patterns.

#### The Challenge

The objectives of this personal challenge are:

1. Implement solutions for the exercises of each pattern.
2. Provide a valuable resource for other learners.
3. Reinforce my own learning and commitment.
4. Improve my unit testing skills.

#### About Programming Patterns

As Bernstein explains:

> Programming patterns are generic solutions to common problems in programming. They are distinguished by their domain (programming) and level of abstraction, which is higher than idioms since they are not specific to any language. However, they are at a lower level of abstraction than design patterns and architectural styles. Using a programming pattern results in a small code fragment that is part of a larger system, while a design pattern or architectural style describes the interactions within a large system."[^2]
